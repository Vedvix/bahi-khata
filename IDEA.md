# Bahikhata - Daily Finance Tracker App

### 1. **Technology Stack for Minimal Cost** üí∞

The key to keeping costs low is to avoid paid cloud services for data storage and to use free, native development tools.

* **Platform:** Use **Android Studio** for your IDE. It's free and is the official development environment for Android.
* **Language:** **Java** is a great choice as you're already familiar with it. It's fully supported for Android development.
* **Frontend:** The UI/UX should be simple and intuitive. You'll build the app's user interface using XML layout files and connect them to your Java code. Use Material Design guidelines for a polished, modern look.
* **Local Storage:** To avoid server costs, all data will be stored on the user's phone.
    * **SQLite database:** This is the most efficient way to handle structured data on a mobile device. It's a lightweight, serverless database that's perfect for a finance tracker. You'll use an SQLite wrapper like **Room** for a more streamlined and robust implementation. Room is a part of Android Jetpack and simplifies database operations.
    * **SharedPreferences:** Use this for storing small amounts of data like user settings or app preferences (e.g., currency symbol, last backup date).

### 2. **Core Features & Architecture** üéØ

To create a comprehensive finance tracker, you'll need the following features, built with a clean, modular architecture.

* **Expense and Income Tracking:** Implement a screen for users to easily add new transactions. Data points should include amount, category, date, and a description.
* **Categories and Tags:** Allow users to create custom categories (e.g., Groceries, Rent, Salary) and tags to better organize their finances.
* **Recurring Transactions:** This is crucial for subscriptions and EMI's. Build a feature to automatically log transactions on a specified schedule (e.g., monthly, weekly).
* **Due Dates and Reminders:** A section for loans and EMIs with a due date and a notification system to remind users. This can be handled using Android's built-in `AlarmManager` or `WorkManager` APIs.
* **Reporting and Analytics:** To provide the best experience, present the data in a meaningful way.
    * **Dashboard:** A home screen showing a quick summary of current balance, recent transactions, and upcoming due dates.
    * **Charts and Graphs:** Use a library like **MPAndroidChart** to visualize spending by category over time. This helps users understand their financial habits.

### 3. **Google Drive Backup** ‚òÅÔ∏è

This is where you handle the "no-cost backup" requirement. You will use the **Google Drive API** to let users back up their local SQLite database file to their personal Google Drive. This is free for the user and requires no server-side infrastructure from your end.

* **Authentication:** Implement **Google Sign-In** to authenticate the user and get permission to access their Google Drive. You'll need to enable the Drive API in the Google Cloud Console and set up OAuth 2.0 credentials.
* **Backup Process:**
    1.  The user taps a "Backup" button.
    2.  Your app signs in the user with their Google Account.
    3.  Once authorized, your app reads the SQLite database file from the phone's internal storage.
    4.  The app uses the Google Drive API to upload the database file to a dedicated, private folder in the user's Google Drive. This data is not counted against your app's quota, so it's a completely free solution for you.
* **Restore Process:**
    1.  The user can select a backup file from their Google Drive.
    2.  Your app downloads the selected file.
    3.  It then replaces the local SQLite database file on their phone with the downloaded one.

### 4. **Delivery and Maintenance** üöÄ

* **Publishing:** Once you've thoroughly tested your app, you can publish it on the **Google Play Store**. There's a one-time registration fee, but no recurring costs.
* **Maintenance:** Focus on a "lean" approach. Launch with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes the essential features. Gather user feedback to guide future updates and feature additions. This prevents you from over-engineering the app and spending time on features no one wants.
